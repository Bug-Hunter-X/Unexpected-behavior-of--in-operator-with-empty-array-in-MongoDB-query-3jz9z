# MongoDB $in operator with empty array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when used with an empty array.  The expected behavior might be to return all documents, but instead, it returns no documents.  This can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug issues in applications.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution to mitigate this issue.
